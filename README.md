#QuickStart

Just build it with Xcode and you can start running it in a simulator (looks best in an iPhone 4S)

#Intro


>Note: I built this app when I was learning Obj-C and back then I was still quite new to static type languages (it was less than a year after I started learning how to code). So please don't read my code. I can assure you that they are quite crappy (there is little or no naming convention, no commenting, everything is in a mess. And unit-testing was a foreign concept at that time). I will be doing a lot of refractoring soon (potentially re-writing the entire app). My intial plan was to open-source it after that. I'm open-sourcing it now only because I'm applying for Thiel Fellowship, and I would like to include this as one of the projects I've worked on.

Project M. was the third project I worked on after dropping out of school at 16. It is the project which I've spent the most time on. But just like the two previous projects of mine (Connect and Imprss), it didn't go very well. I ended up shelving it in 2013.

#So what is Project M?

Project M is an app project aimming to change the way pre-university education in  Singapore is carried out.

I believe that interest plays a huge role in the process of knowledge acquisition. An education system should focus on getting students to be interested in what they are learning, rather than using standardized testing to force students to "study" things that they have no interest in, which is basically what most education systems around the world are doing right now.

There needs to be an education reform. A revolution.

M. is a series of mobile apps speically designed for pre-university students as a "hack" for self-learning. These apps would first explain the concepts to students in the simplest way possible, then get into the details in an easy-to-follow manner. They would provide students with techniques on how to apply what they've learnt (to solve problem, as a way of thinking, etc), and contain a database of interesting questions (and paradoxes) related to the concepts. The language used would be consice and straight to the point. Basically, these apps would be designed in such a way that those who are interested in what they are learning would be able to learn everything by themselves without the need of a teacher.

This is to reduce the amount of teaching a teacher needs to do. Or rather, this is to demonstrate that teachers are not always required. I believe the process of learning can truly occur only when it is self-driven.

>“Men are born ignorant, not stupid; they are made stupid by education." - Bertrand Russel

I believe everyone is born an autodidact. Forcing students to "learn" is never going to work. Rather than teachers that treat teaching as simply delivering information, what we really need in schools are mentors. Mentors that insipre and encourage children to learn; mentors that give guidances and engage with learners.

#Why did I shelve it?
Things were progressing rather slowly. A year had passed but the app wasn't quite there yet. I don't want to admit it, but I was quite a naive person back then. I tried to do everything by myself. As a one-man team, I was in charged of designing the GUI, building the iOS app, writing the content and creating the illustrations. I ended up spending about a year working on this project, before finally coming to the conclusion that perseverance was not going to bring me anywhere, I needed to stop daydreaming and realize that I do need a team for a project this ambitious. And as a developer, I was not good enough to work on a project like this. There were a lot more I needed to learn.

So I had it shelved, did my SATs [and got 760/800 for both SAT II physics and maths, but only 1780/2400 for SAT I (could have gotten >2200  but I screwed it up. Initially I was rather ashamed of myself, but then I decided I shouldn't dwell upon the past)] and started freelancing, before getting my first full-time as a full stack developer at a Singapore-based start-up.
